"""
Cross Origin Resource Sharing - refers to the situations when a frontend running
in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend,
and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend

You can also specify whether your backend allows:

    Credentials (Authorization headers, Cookies, etc).
    Specific HTTP methods (POST, PUT) or all of them with the wildcard "*".
    Specific HTTP headers or all of them with the wildcard "*".

"""
"""
- allow_origins - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests.
- allow_origin_regex - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to
    make cross-origin requests. e.g. `'https://.*\\.example\.org'`.
- allow_methods - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests.
    Defaults to ['GET']
- allow_headers - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin
    requests. Defaults to []. You can use ['*'] to allow all headers.
    The Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed
    for simple CORS requests
- allow_credentials - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests.
    Defaults to False. Also, allow_origins cannot be set to ['*'] for credentials to be allowed,
    origins must be specified.
- expose_headers - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser.
    Defaults to [].
- max_age - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses.
    Defaults to 600.

# CORS preflight requests

    These are any OPTIONS request with Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method headers.
    In this case the middleware will intercept the incoming request and respond with
    appropriate CORS headers, and either a 200 or 400 response for informational purposes.

# Simple requests
    Any request with an Origin header. In this case the middleware will pass the request
    through as normal, but will include appropriate CORS headers on the response.
